      <h4>How long will my highlights last?</h4>
      <h5>
        Even though our highlights are usually done with permanent color,
        eventually they will grow out within 5-8 weeks. We recommend having your
        highlights touched up every 6 weeks.

      <h4>What if I want to donate my hair?</h4>
      <h5>
        We do this all the time! If you would like to donate your hair to Locks
        of Love, make sure it is long enough to cut a 10 inch ponytail off. The
        ponytail needs to be placed in a Ziploc bag and sent in to Locks of
        Love. Please note that we do not send the hair in here at the salon. It
        is up to you to send the hair once it is cut.
